While there are varying opinions of him floating around the internet he was an entertainer like no other who loved gaming with every fiber of his being. 

While he took a look at League in its infancy (Source: https://youtu.be/Z_78J6FEouM) he gained enough referrals to receive an item named after him. The Total Biscuit of Rejuvenation now known as the Total Biscuit of Everlasting Will.

In a way, through this game we all play he lives on, and the sincerest condolences go out to the work that he did and to his family.

Throughout the entire game he goes on about how bad his teammates are and that the way they play should be bannable. All while being 2/8 before ending 2/11.

After this he bans 20+ people from his chat after he went over the vod and asked twitch chat who's fault that game was and they responded 'you'.

How is this guy not indefinitely banned? All of this happened while streaming to his young, impressionable fan base.

Edit: For the people asking for [a clip of him afking](https://streamable.com/wmowb) . Sat in base while his team wanted to keep playing. Unfortunately I can't get a clip from the stream because vods are sub only. Would like to add that he had said earlier in the stream that he would have afked earlier if he wasn't streaming.",2019-08-09 14:23:27
"I'm almost 43, I just hit Gold, and I have no one to tell it to.",41529,h9hxzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/h9hxzf/im_almost_43_i_just_hit_gold_and_i_have_no_one_to/,1682,1592261822,"TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.

I've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.

When we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.

The problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.

So what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.

This afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.

So there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",2020-06-16 06:57:02

Riot is forcing me to change my name due to Coronavirus.,39929,g18sl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/g18sl2/riot_is_forcing_me_to_change_my_name_due_to/,3465,1586910758,"Hey all, 

So I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. 

As I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. 

At the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just ""Corona"" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).

I'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat ""nice name"" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. 

After two weeks of back and forth with multiple ""Player Support Specialists"", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**

This to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name ""Corona"" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name ""Corona"", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.

EDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc
Proof of ID has also been privately sent.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!",2020-04-15 08:32:38

After a long day on the ranch, I pour myself a tall glass of milk, huff some paint, and log on to the Dell I got for Christmas in 2006 with Windows XP to play some League of Legends.


The client needs to patch. That's fine. I reheat a bowl of beans and lard for supper, and it's already at 13% by the time I get back, well ahead of schedule. I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job. 


I queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go.


The first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.


Midgame I have sunfire and I tp botlane to gank. They have thst new champ Aphelios shootijg weird bubble guns at me. There's a tirret or sometbjng? Idk anuway I kill him by running at his face pressing e amd right clicking him to death. I miss all three cleavers I throw. It doesn't matter.

How should I deal with being held hostage in a ranked game for over four hours by colluding duos?,27824,7n08zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7n08zw/how_should_i_deal_with_being_held_hostage_in_a/,1928,1514646507,"https://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/196203142/201042280?tab=overview

If I just abandon the game, I get punished for AFK but there's no other in-game thing I can do to stop being griefed? During this match there were four players who paired as two duos, popped into each other (now they control both teams ff's). By the time anybody realized what was happening, the duos were farmed enough to 2v3. So whenever a team went to end, they would communicate to their friends on the enemy team and prevent a team from ending the game. 

I've learned that this is something they've planned and executed before: https://twitter.com/mordeeasy2getlp/status/936469118097571840

and that Riot actually encountered this game and didn't look into any possibility of collusion. In fact, they arguably celebrated this here: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/11/ask-riot-longest-game-ever/

Here's their youtube upload of the prior colluded game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxwlzP0FX0

I just have no idea what i'meant to do against such organized and dedicated griefing. I can't submit a ticket, i'll just get told to report them in post-game and they do the usual nothing about a ticketed complaint. So I need to get to end screen to report them. Oh btw, the client has bugged on end screen and i'm stuck at ""skip waiting for stats"" so now I can't even report them.",2017-12-30 23:08:27
